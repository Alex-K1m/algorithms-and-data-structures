# Algorithms & data structures

This repo contains implementations of algorithms and data structures written in javascript for educational purposes. I took a test driven development (TDD) approach and added type checking js code with typescript & jsdoc comments.

## Cheat sheet

### Linked list

_Singly linked list_ - a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes, each holding a value and a reference to the next node, the last one of which is linked to a terminator.

- ‚úîÔ∏è efficient insertion or removal (during iteration) without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
- ‚ùå does not allow direct access

Common interface:

- `head` - first node
- `tail` - either everything except head, or last node
- `last` - last node
- `prepend(value)`
- `append(value)`
- `delete(value)`
- `deleteHead()` (Last, Tail)
- `find(value)`
- other methods applicable to lists

Can be used to implement ADTs: list, stack, queue, associative array

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|   n    |   n    |     1     |    1     |

### Doubly linked list

Each node holds additional reference to the previous node (or terminator). Has the same pros/cons as linked list, but also (compared to linked list):

- ‚úîÔ∏è can be traversed backwards
- ‚úîÔ∏è no need to keep previous node while traversing

common interface: same

Can be used to implement deque

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|   n    |   n    |     1     |    1     |

[ü†ï data-structures](#data-structures)

### Stack

An abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations (LIFO):

- push - adds an element to the collection
- pop - removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

Common interface:

- `top`
- `push(value)`
- `pop()`
- `peek()`

Can be implemented with array, linked list

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|   n    |   n    |     1     |    1     |

[ü†ï data-structures](#data-structures)

### Queue

An abstract data type, a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence (FIFO).

Common interface:

- `front`
- `rear`
- `enqueue(value)`
- `dequeue()`
- `peek()`

Can be implemented with linked list

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|   n    |   n    |     1     |    1     |

### Priority queue

Additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. An element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Common interface: same with additional priority parameter for some methods, could be `insert`/`pull` instead of enqueue/dequeue.

Can be implemented with heap

### Deque

_Double ended queue_ is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front or rear (back). Thus, it does not follow FIFO rule. Could be:

- input restricted - input is restricted at a single end but allows deletion at both the ends
- output restricted - output is restricted at a single end but allows insertion at both the ends

Common interface:

- `addFront(value)`
- `addBack(value)`
- `removeFront()`
- `removeBack()`
- `peekFront()`
- `peekBack()`

Can be implemented with doubly linked list

### Hash table

_Hash table/map_ is a data structure that can map keys to values. Uses a _hash function_ to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions. Such collisions must be accommodated in some way.

Common interface:

- `set(key, value)`
- `get(key)`
- `delete(key)`
- `has(key)`

Can be used to implement ADTs: associative array

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|  n/a   |  1, n  |   1, n    |   1, n   |

[ü†ï data-structures](#data-structures)

### Heap

A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is:

- _min heap_ - always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes (min heap property)
- _max heap_ - always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes (max heap property)

The node at the "top" of the heap with no parents is called the root node. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a binary tree.

Common interface:

- `heapify()` (up, down)
- `add(value)`
- `poll()`
- `peek()`
- `delete(value)`

Can be implemented with array

| Find Min/Max | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----------: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|      1       | log n  |   log n   |  log n   |
